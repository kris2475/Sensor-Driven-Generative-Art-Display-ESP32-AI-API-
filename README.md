# Ambient-Light-to-Image-Generation-System
This system utilises an ESP32 connected to a triad sensor (colour) to ascertain ambient lighting mood. The data is transmitted via WiFi using JSON to a cloud service where an LLM interprets the mood and cues an AI-generated image. The resultant image is displayed on the ST7789 LCD for real-time visualisation, creating a dynamic atmospheric display.
